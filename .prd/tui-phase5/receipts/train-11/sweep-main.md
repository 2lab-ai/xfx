## Coverage

fx's inventory (v0.0.16): 45 surfaces -- 38 commands, 7 key hints. Covered by a scenario: 45. **Uncovered: 0**.
Tokens typed as commands that are no command of this inventory (aliases, partial names, refusals): `/al`, `/balance`, `/co`, `/cost`, `/de`, `/e`, `/ef`, `/eff`, `/et`, `/ex`, `/exit`, `/f`, `/fo`, `/img`, `/mo`, `/nosuch`, `/notacommand`, `/q`, `/re`, `/se`, `/setup`, `/st`, `/vers`.

## Pass

Scenarios: 96 -- ran 96, failed 0, timeout 0.

**pass = 379 / 537 = 70.6%**

| total | ran | identical | normalized-identical | approved-divergence | approved-divergence-cascade | replaced-in-next-pin | unresolved-defect | failed | timeout |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 537 | 537 | 16 | 363 | 9 | 8 | 0 | 141 | 0 | 0 |

The unit is the snap pair: one `snap` or `snapfull` label of a scenario, read from its .cap file, so a scenario that failed or timed out counts every snap it would have taken. pass = (identical + normalized-identical) / total. approved-divergence-cascade is a pair that differs by position beyond its approved rows (a row they pushed down) and whose every row left without a match, the two sides aligned as sequences, is approved; the positional diff stays in the raw output.

## By group

Groups are the leading letters of a scenario's name (`model-anchor`, `model2` and `model` are `model`). A scenario counts under every surface it exercises, so the surface rows overlap.

## Causes of the unresolved snaps

141 unresolved snaps; a snap counts under every cause of one of its rows (`only`: that cause alone).
Kinds: a = awaiting a user decision, b = a unit in flight, c = the capture (nondeterminism, or the scenario script), d = a defect.
